# **Task 6 – Strong Password Creation and Password Strength Evaluation**

## **Objective**

The objective of this task is to understand the factors that make a password strong, create sample passwords with different levels of complexity, evaluate their strength using online tools, and analyze how password complexity protects against cyber-attacks.

## **Observations**

| Weak Password                | Strong Password                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Short                        | Long                                             |
| Dictionary words             | Unpredictable patterns                           |
| Only letters/numbers         | Mix of uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols |
| Predictable pattern          | Random & unique                                  |
| Easy to guess by brute force | Extremely difficult to crack                     |

> **Password length has more impact than complexity alone.**
> A *passphrase* (long sentence-style password) is more secure than a short complex password.

## **Cybersecurity Concepts Learned**

### 🔹 1. What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password:

* Is **at least 12–16 characters long**
* Uses **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
* Does **not contain dictionary words or personal information**
* Is **unique for every website/service**

### 🔹 2. Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | How It Works           | Weak Password Example  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Brute Force         | Tries all combinations | `abcd`, `1234`         |
| Dictionary Attack   | Tries common words     | `password`, `iloveyou` |
| Credential Stuffing | Uses leaked passwords  | Reusing same password  |

### 🔹 3. Role of Password Length

More characters exponentially increase cracking time.
Example:
8-character password → minutes to crack
16-character password → millions of years to crack

### 🔹 4. Passphrases

A **passphrase** is a long password formed like a sentence.
Example: `MyCatLovesFishOnSundays!`
✔ Easy to remember
✔ Hard to brute-force

### 🔹 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA increases security by requiring **something you know + something you have (OTP/device) + something you are (biometrics)**.

### 🔹 6. Password Managers

Password managers:

* Generate strong passwords
* Store them securely
* Prevent password reuse

## **Best Practices for Password Security**

| Do                              | Don’t                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Use 12–16+ characters           | Use personal info (DOB/name)        |
| Enable MFA                      | Reuse same password everywhere      |
| Use password manager            | Save passwords in Notes or WhatsApp |
| Create passphrases              | Use `12345`, `qwerty`, `password`   |
| Change passwords after a breach | Share passwords                     |

## **Conclusion**

This task helped in understanding how password length, randomness, and complexity directly impact security. Using strong passwords and MFA greatly reduces the chances of account compromise. The best practice is to use long **unpredictable passphrases** and store them securely using a **password manager**.
